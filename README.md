# Delivering a device appropriate version of an image with CSS and JavaScript

## Description

### Goals:

- display a small sized version of a background-image for all devices, no more than 480px tall if in portrait mode, and no more than 480px wide if in landscape mode.

- deliver a large version of that image, adapted to the screen resolution of the device it is viewed on, an open it in the jQuery lightbox Magnific Popup.

- make the large version of the image adapt to the largest dimension of the device. For example, if we have a breakpoint at 640px in our CSS Media Queries and our device screen resolution is 360px by 640px; if our image is in portrait mode, its height is going to be 640px, and if it is in landscape mode, its width is going to be 640px.

- serve the same image, whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode on most common mobile devices, to avoid downloading a new image after a change in orientation. Devices and resolutions covered will be the ones found in Google Chrome Version 44 devTools, Device Mode and Mobile Emulation.

- add support for high resolution display with a device pixel ratio equal or superior to 2.

### Challenge:

match CSS Media Queries in JavaScript.

With CSS Media Queries, when different declarations try to set a value for the same element/property combination the conflict must somehow be resolved by cascading, and when no declarations try to set a value for an element/property combination, a value is to be found by way of inheritance or by looking at the propertyâ€™s initial value.

On the other hand, within Javascript, although the key API window.matchMedia can detect Media Query state change, it does not respond to the same principles of cascading and inheritance as CSS Media Queries.


This plugin displays a list of upcoming events in a descending order, and a list of past events in an ascending order.

```javascript

jQuery(function() {
    /*! Settings for the future events list (will overwrite the default settings) */
    $("#gcfr-futureEventsList").gCalFeedReader({
        apiKey: 'AIzaSyDCgE5k8RmNM4uvX1j9vsZCjremXVhM83Y', // replace with your own Google API key
        calendarId: "4dj3qghfgp23sjhe12c2b3505s@group.calendar.google.com", // replace with your own Google public calendar ID
        futureEventsOnly: true,
        sortDescending: false,
        eventsHeader: 'Upcoming Events'
    });
    /*! Settings for the past events list (will overwrite the default settings)*/
    $("#gcfr-pastEventsList").gCalFeedReader({
        apiKey: 'AIzaSyDCgE5k8RmNM4uvX1j9vsZCjremXVhM83Y', // replace with your own Google API key
        calendarId: "4dj3qghfgp23sjhe12c2b3505s@group.calendar.google.com", // replace with your own Google public calendar ID
        pastEventsOnly: true,
        sortDescending: true,
        eventsHeader: 'Past Events'
    });
});

```

Include the following HTML code into the body of your document.

```html

<div class="gCalFeedReader"></div>

```

Replace the apiKey option with your own Google API key. You can get a Google api key by navigating to the [Google Developpers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

Replace the calendarId option with your own Google public calendar id.

Make sure you Google calendar is public.
